# Node.js API

A simple REST API built with Node.js, Prisma, and Axios, focused on managing a User table. This project serves as a practical exercise in API development, database interaction, and external API consumption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X or higher - specify a version if important)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite - specify which one you used)

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/OlaiaAly/api-node.git](https://github.com/OlaiaAly/v.git)

    cd api-node
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Database setup:

    - Explain how to set up the database connection. This is _crucial_. For example:
      - "Create a database named `your_database_name` in your database system."
      - "Configure the database connection details in the `.env` file." (If you're using environment variables â€“ recommended). Provide a `.env.example` for users to copy and adapt.
      - "Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`"

### Running the API

```bash
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```
